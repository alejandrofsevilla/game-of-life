# Game of Life

A visual representation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a type of cellular automata invented by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## About the Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game that evolves based on its initial state. The rules are simple yet give rise to complex patterns. Cells in a grid live, die, or multiply based on the following rules:
- Any live cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies (underpopulation).
- Any live cell with two or three living neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three living neighbors dies (overpopulation).
- Any dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes a living cell (reproduction).

## Features

- **Add/Remove Cells [Mouse Left].**
- **Load/Save Patterns [L/S].**\
  Pattern files are stored in folder <em>/patterns</em> using [Run Length Encoded](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded) format. Example of pattern files can be found at [https://conwaylife.com/wiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki).
- **Generate Population [G].**\
  Fill the grid with a random pattern of living cells.
- **Reset [R].**\
  Reset active pattern to its initial configuration.
- **Clear Grid [G].**
- **Change Grid Size [Up/Down].**\
  Maximum grid size currently set to 960x490 cells.
- **Control Zoom [Mouse Wheel].**
- **Control Update Speed [Left/Right].**
- **Drag View [Mouse Right].**
